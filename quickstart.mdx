## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:
- A valid account with payment method added
- An SSH key pair generated for secure access

## Create Your First Instance

1. **Navigate to Instances**
   Go to the [Dashboard](https://console.usenubis.com) and click "Create Instance"

2. **Choose Configuration**
   - Select your preferred region
   - Choose an instance size (we recommend starting with 2GB RAM)
   - Select an operating system (Ubuntu, Debian, or CentOS)

3. **Configure Networking**
   - Assign a reserved IP or use dynamic IP
   - Set up firewall rules for SSH (port 22)

4. **Launch**
   Click "Create Instance" and wait for provisioning (usually 1-2 minutes)

## Connect via SSH

Once your instance is ready, connect using SSH:

```bash
ssh root@your-instance-ip
```

If you used a non-root user:

```bash
ssh username@your-instance-ip -i ~/.ssh/your-key.pem
```

## Configure Your Instance

Update your system:

```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian
apt update && apt upgrade -y

# For CentOS/RHEL
yum update -y
```

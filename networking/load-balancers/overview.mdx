## What are Load Balancers?

Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances to ensure high availability and optimal performance. They automatically route requests to healthy instances.

## Features

- **Automatic Failover**: Route traffic away from unhealthy instances
- **SSL Termination**: Handle HTTPS at the load balancer
- **Health Checks**: Continuously monitor instance health
- **Sticky Sessions**: Route users to the same instance
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Round robin, least connections, IP hash

## How It Works

<Accordion title="Traffic Flow">
1. User sends request to load balancer IP
2. Load balancer checks health of backend instances
3. Request is routed to a healthy instance
4. Response is returned to user
5. Unhealthy instances are marked and bypassed
</Accordion>

## Configuration Options

### Health Checks

Configure checks to monitor instance health:
- **HTTP**: Check specific endpoint (e.g., `/health`)
- **TCP**: Basic connectivity check
- **Interval**: How often to check (5s - 60s)
- **Timeout**: Response timeout (2s - 5s)

### Load Balancing Algorithm

Choose how traffic is distributed:
- **Round Robin**: Evenly distribute across instances
- **Least Connections**: Route to instance with fewest connections
- **IP Hash**: Route based on source IP for session stickiness

## Creating a Load Balancer

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Load Balancer">
    Navigate to Networking → Load Balancers → Create
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Backend Instances">
    Select instances to distribute traffic across
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Health Checks">
    Set up monitoring for your applications
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Reserved IP">
    Optional: Use a static IP address
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pricing

- **Standard**: $10/month + $0.02/GB processed
- **Enterprise**: $50/month + $0.015/GB processed (includes DDoS protection)

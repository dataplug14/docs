## What is RBAC?

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows you to manage permissions for team members through roles. Instead of assigning individual permissions, you assign roles that contain predefined permission sets.

## Key Concepts

### Roles
Predefined sets of permissions that determine what a user can do:
- **Owner**: Full account access
- **Admin**: Manage resources and team members
- **Developer**: Create and manage resources
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

### Permissions
Granular actions that can be performed:
- Create/delete instances
- Manage billing
- View resources
- Manage team members

### Users
Team members who are assigned roles.

## Getting Started

<Steps>

  <Step title="Assign Role">
    Select a role for the new team member
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send Invitation">
    The member will receive an email invitation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom Roles

Create custom roles with specific permissions:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Roles**
2. Click **"Create Role"**
3. Name your role
4. Select permissions
5. Save the role

## Best Practices

<Warning>
Start with the principle of least privilege. Grant only necessary permissions.
</Warning>

- Use viewer roles for contractors and auditors
- Limit billing access to trusted administrators
- Review team access quarterly
- Remove access immediately when team members leave

## API Authentication

All API requests require authentication using API keys or OAuth tokens.

## API Keys

API keys provide programmatic access to your account.

### Creating an API Key

1. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **API Keys**
2. Click **"Generate New Key"**
3. Name your key and set expiration
4. Copy and store your key securely

<Warning>
API keys are displayed only once. Store them securely.
</Warning>

### Using API Keys

Include your API key in requests:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.usenubis.com/v1/instances
```

## OAuth

OAuth allows third-party applications to access your account securely.

See [API Keys](/authentication/api-keys) for detailed documentation.
